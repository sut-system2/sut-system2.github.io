      In 2011, the book *Thinking, Fast and Slow* introduced a fundamental concept in human cognition: we operate using two modes of thinking and problem-solving:

      - **Fast Thinking (System 1):** Intuitive, automatic, and subconscious—like recognizing a face or driving a familiar route.
      
      - **Slow Thinking (System 2):** Deliberate, logical, and effortful—like solving a math problem or planning a strategy.

      Modern AI, particularly deep learning, excels at **System 1 tasks** but struggles with reasoning, abstraction, and decision-making—key aspects of **System 2 thinking**.

      This course, **System 2**, explores AI techniques beyond deep learning to enable structured reasoning and problem-solving. Topics include:

      - Neurosymbolic methods
      
      - Program synthesis
      
      - Test-time computation/adaptation
      
      - RL-integrated LLMs
      
      - LLMs & Abstraction
      
      - Agentic LLMs
      
      - Compositionality
